 The pain does change when I stand up.
When I stand up, it feels less of a sharp pain only when I'm sitting down.

--- Speaker SPEAKER_00 ---
Okay, that's good to know.
It could be related to your posture while sitting.
Perhaps try adjusting your chair or adding some lumbar support.
Does that make any difference?

--- Speaker SPEAKER_01 ---
No, I don't think so because my chair is a bit too soft.

--- Speaker SPEAKER_00 ---
 Yes, a soft chair might not provide enough support, especially for your back.
That could definitely contribute to the pain, perhaps try a firmer chair or add a cushion for better support.
