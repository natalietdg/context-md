 The pain does change when I stand up.
When I stand up, it feels less of a sharp pain only when I'm sitting down.
Okay, that's good to know.
It could be related to your posture while sitting.
Perhaps try adjusting your chair or adding some lumbar support.
Does that make any difference?
No, I don't think so because my chair is a bit too soft.
 Yes, a soft chair might not provide enough support, especially for your back.
That could definitely contribute to the pain, perhaps try a firmer chair or add a cushion for better support.
